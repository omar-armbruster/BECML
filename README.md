# BECML
This repository contains snapshots of my research with Professor Chris Herdman at Middlebury College where we are using machine learning to characterize Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). My research primarily focuses on unsupervised learning, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), which we use to dimensionally reduce simulated images in conjunction with spectral clustering to classify whether a given image is above or below the condensation temperature for BECs. I am currently using these methods to classify simulated images of BECs (which are generated using the Thomas-Fermi and Bose-Enhanced models), but hope to eventually apply them to experimental images from NASA's Cold Atom Laboratory.
